This repository contains my **Form 5 Computer Science Portfolio (2020)** project.

The project is a **Cinema Management System** designed to simulate how a cinema manages movie screenings, ticket bookings, and customer interactions.

---

## 🎓 Academic Context

This project was completed as part of the **Computer Science (Sains Komputer)** subject during **Form 5**, which is the final year of Malaysian secondary school before the **SPM examination**.

**Level:** Form 5 (Secondary School / SPM)

**Curriculum:** Sains Komputer (Computer Science)

**Language:** Bahasa Melayu (The system, database labels, and documentation are in Malay as per the national curriculum requirements).

**Contribution:** 100% Solo Project. I was responsible for the full-stack development, including database design (ERD), backend logic (PHP), and frontend UI/UX (HTML/CSS).


## 📝 Language & Localisation

> [!NOTE]
> As this project was developed for the Malaysian SPM Sains Komputer curriculum, the User Interface (UI), system messages, and technical documentation are primarily in Bahasa Melayu.


## 👤 My Role: Sole Developer
As this was an individual folio project, I managed the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), including:

System Analysis: Planning the cinema booking workflow.

Database Architecture: Designing relational tables in MySQL.

Backend Development: Writing PHP scripts for data processing.

Frontend Design: Creating the user and admin interfaces.

## 📖 Project Overview

This is a **Legacy Archive** of my high school Computer Science Portfolio. It is a full-stack **Cinema Management System** designed to handle movie screenings, seat availability, and customer ticket bookings. 

> [!NOTE]
> This project is preserved as a record of my early technical journey and foundational understanding of **CRUD operations** and **relational database design**.

It allows users to:
- View available movies
- Check movie showtimes
- Book movie tickets
- Manage simple booking information

This project was created to apply the **programming and system design concepts** learned in the **Sains Komputer (Computer Science)** subject during Form 5.


## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Develop a basic cinema management application
- Apply programming and logical thinking skills
- Understand how booking systems work
- Practice designing a user interface
- Demonstrate system planning and development

---

## 🎬 System Features

The system includes the following features:

- 🎥 Movie listing
- 🕒 Showtimes display
- 🎟 Ticket booking
- 👤 Customer information handling
- 📋 Basic data management

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

Through the development of this system, I achieved the following milestones in my technical journey:

* **Full-Stack Foundations:** Gained hands-on experience connecting a **PHP** backend to a **MySQL** database to handle dynamic data.
* **System Architecture:** Learned how to plan a logical user flow, from registration and login to the final ticket booking confirmation.
* **Data Integrity:** Implemented basic form validation and learned how to structure relational database tables for efficient storage.
* **Technical Documentation:** Developed the ability to translate complex code into readable manuals, as seen in the [**DOKUMENTASI HOR PEI YU.pdf**](https://github.com/pyhor/form5-cinema-management-system/blob/main/DOKUMENTASI%20HOR%20PEI%20YU.pdf).
* **Problem Solving:** Debugged real-world scenarios, such as ensuring seat availability updates correctly after a successful booking.
* **User Interface Design:** Created intuitive and responsive interfaces using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, ensuring smooth interactions for customers during movie browsing, login, registration, and ticket booking.

## 🚀 How to Run (Local Setup)

To run this project locally, you will need a local server environment like **XAMPP**.

1. **Move Project Files:** Copy the contents of the `PHP Coding/` folder into the XAMPP `htdocs` directory (e.g., `C:\xampp\htdocs\cinema-system\`).
   
2. **Database Setup:**
   - Start **Apache** and **MySQL** in the XAMPP Control Panel.
   - Go to `localhost/phpmyadmin` and create a new database.
   - Import the provided SQL file (if available) or refer to the documentation for table structures.

3. **Configuration:**
   Update the database connection settings in the PHP files (usually `db_connection.php` or similar) to match the local MySQL credentials.

4. **Access the App:**
   Open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost/cinema-system/index.html`.
